<p>The section <a class="reference internal" href="webbasics.html"><em>Web page Basics</em></a> compares HTML format with
other document formats.  Here we concentrate on HTML:
Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
<p>I use a convenient plain text editor, Sublime Text
(free download at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">https://www.sublimetext.com/3</a>)
that colors the syntax of html source, much as Idle colors Python syntax.
This is an <em>advantage</em> over Kompozer.</p>
<p>Unlike hybrid editors such as Kompozer, the editor only shows the raw HTML text,
not the way it looks in a browser.
With a plain text editor like this,
you have a couple extra steps to look at the formatted view:
You need to save the file, and separately load it into a browser.
If you make a change to the html source,
and want to see what that changes in the browser view,
then you need to save the source file again,
and then get the browser to <em>reload</em> the page.</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="index-1">
<dt><strong>Mac users &#8211; TextEdit</strong>:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">You can also edit
raw html with the included Mac app TextEdit,
but with several steps to <em>change</em> the defaults.
(The initial defaults are to show <em>no</em> html source.)
Since TextEdit does not do syntax coloring,
an editor like Sublime Text is likely better,
as long as you do not mind doing one extra download.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> want to
use TextEdit to see and edit html source:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>Open TextEdit,</li>
<li>Click on Help in the menu bar</li>
<li>Select <em>TextEdit help page</em></li>
<li>In the list that pops up, select &#8220;Work with HTML documents&#8221;.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in the section
&#8220;Always open HTML files in code-editing mode&#8221;.</li>
<li>As a beginner, I suggest these settings in the last help section,
&#8220;Change how HTML files are saved&#8221;:<ul>
<li>In 2. select  the CCS style &#8220;No CSS&#8221;.  Leave the defaults for document type and encoding.</li>
<li>In 3. do <em>not</em> select preserve white space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, for everyone, we get into the first simple example,
the raw html for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hello.html</span></code>.

</td></tr></table></div>
<p>You are encouraged to open it both in a plain text editor
like Sublime Text or Mac TextEdit and in a browser.
The other HTML files discussed here, are in the same folder,
and you are encouraged to open them in the same two ways.</p>
<p>With the html source text coloring in this tutorial.
the only text that you will see in a browser&#8217;s usual formatted view
is what appears as black in the image.
Everything else is markup.  Markup tag names are boldface, and colored dark blue.
Most of the markup appears inside angle brackets, and most
markup has both an opening and a closing tag, with affected contents in between,
like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;title&gt;</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;/title&gt;</span></code> in line 4.  The closing tag has a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code>
right after the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>Much of the markup is boilerplate -
I am not going to explain it much.</p>
<p>In particular all the part through the opening tag for the body, &lt;body&gt;,
in lines 1-7 is standard for our very simple pages,
except for the bit in black, inside the title markup,
on line 4.  The title text appears in the <em>tab label</em> in your browser,
<em>not</em> inside the formatted page that appears in the browser.</p>
<p>The only parts you actually see on the page are inside the body:
here the body contents are in lines 8-11.</p>
<p>You are likely to want to start with a heading.
Line 8 uses the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;h1&gt;</span></code> markup to create a main heading.</p>
<p>I spaced the text in the body in a strange way, to illustrate
a major feature of html: It reformats if you change the window width.
That means the browser generally <em>chooses the places to wrap</em> to the next line.
In particular <em>any amount of white space</em>, including newlines in your
raw text, are merely treated as a place
where <em>there could be a break to the next line</em>,
or it could just display as a <em>single</em> space before the next word.</p>
<p>Unless you have an extremely narrow window where you display
hello.html in your browser, you should see &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221;
all on one line.  That means the newline after &#8220;Hello,&#8221; in the source text
and the blanks before &#8220;world&#8221;,
just turn into a single space when displayed.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want an explicit line break, that shows in the browser.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;br&gt;</span></code> markup forces a line break.
(There are much more flexible ways to break to a new line,
like using the paragraph tag, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;p&gt;</span></code>, but we are keeping things simple here.)</p>
<p>In hello.html, that means that no matter how wide your browser window is,
you will always see &#8220;It is a fine day.&#8221;
starting on a line <em>after</em> &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221;,
because of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;br&gt;</span></code> on line 10.</p>
<p>This compression of white space also means that I can indent
to help me keep track of
multi-line contents between opening and closing markup,
and this does not change the html formatting.</p>
<p>The final two lines 12-13 are also standard boilerplate,
closing the tags that were started earlier
for the body and the entire html section.</p>
<p>There is plenty more formatting markup for fonts, text size,
paragraphs, ...
that is not discussed here.
Common document editors like Microsoft
Word and Open Office
<em>do</em> allow you to generate static html files.
However the source html text is NOT visible through these editors,
and they all add lots of extra detailed formatting information in the html source
that greatly lengthens the file and obscures the text that you do add.
Also,
such editors cannot handle html <em>forms</em>.</p>
<p>For the exercises, I am expecting a pattern with output page templates.
The templates are just static html files (that later get modified by the string format operation
inside your Python program).</p>
<p>An example is the output template for the adder programs: the initial testing program additionWeb.py and the later cgi server program adder.cgi.
The template file is additionTemplate.html in the www examples folder:</p>

    <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>

        <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Addition Answer<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

        The result is: <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
        {num1} + {num2} = {total}

    <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>The text that is <em>not</em> inside tags is what you will see <em>if</em> this page is displayed directly in a browser,
including the formatting instructions in curly braces.</p>
<p>The Python adder programs do not display this page directly.  Instead they use it as a format string,
so the substitutions into the curly braces are made before the page is displayed.</p>
<div class="section" id="special-characters">
<span id="index-2"></span><h2>5.4.1. Special characters<a class="headerlink" href="#special-characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We had markup in Python string literal notation for special characters.
For the strings the markup all started with the backslash character,
so &#8216;\n&#8217; is a newline, &#8216;\\&#8217; is a displayed backslash ....</p>
<p>In html <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> have special meaning,
so if we want to <em>see</em> those symbols in the browser,
we need a special substitute for the individual characters in the raw html.
Those substitutes start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a semicolon (;),
with an abbreviation in between:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> is replaced by &amp;lt;</div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> is replaced by &amp;gt;</div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> is replaced by &amp;amp;</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> now is used specially for character markup, we need the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;amp;</span></code>
to <em>display</em> an ampersand in the browser.</p>
<p>The collapsing of whitespace sequences is a feature of html.
If you really want more spaces in sequence,
you can use a character that looks like a space,
but is not considered as whitespace by the html formatter.
The character markup is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;nbsp;</span></code> abbreviating
Non-Breaking SPace.</p>
<p>You can put arbitrary text, possibly with some special character codes,
<em>outside</em> of tags, and it will be displayed for the user to see in a browser.</p>

<p>For a page that is totally static,
or just displaying output from a
server cgi program, you do not need
form syntax.
However if you want the user to input data into
a cgi program from a web page, then you need a form.
Static document generation apps are no use here!</p>
<p>First we introduce the basic syntax needed for

<p>This page includes a simple form, lines 11-19.</p>
<p>A form can only appear nested inside the body.
Input tags can only appear inside the form.</p>
<p>Unlike the opening markup for tags introduced so far,
input tags include not only the tag name, but also <em>attributes</em>
are inside the angle brackets after the tag.</p>
<p>This is illustrated in line 11 for the form,
with syntax coloring, with attribute assignments in light blue.</p>
<p>Attributes have a standard format,
with an attribute identifier and an equal sign
and a double-quoted string.
Attribute assignments are separated by whitespace.</p>
<p>In line 11 the form attributes are <strong>action</strong>, <strong>method</strong> and <strong>enctype</strong>.
We will not edit the attribute identifiers.
The only things inside the opening tags that we will edit for new
examples are the <em>contents of some of the quoted strings</em>.
This way it is not important in this course
for you to learn a bunch of html syntax.  You can copy models,
and modify just data in quoted strings.</p>
<p>The syntax for an attribute looks like a Python assignment statement,
with the string on the right being the value assigned to the attribute.</p>
<p>A form requires a further markup tag inside of it: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></code>.</p>
<p>Some confusion is possible here from the fact <strong>value</strong>
is also the name of a required attribute for a input tag,
and all attributes have a string assigned as their value.  I will try to use the phrase &#8220;string value&#8221; consistently for the second usage, and I will try to show the
attribute names in boldface, so <strong>value</strong> refers to the attribute name used inside an input tag.
Or I will show a full attribute assignment like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">value=&quot;0&quot;</span></code>.</p>
<p>The one form attribute that is important to modify correctly is
the <strong>action</strong> attribute.  Its string value should be the server program
that will act on the data coming from the inputs in the form.
In this case that is adder.cgi.  Be sure you update this field
when you copy to modify for a new page!</p>
<p>The generic input tags used to get data in a form are
like in lines 13 and 15.  Input tags do not have a closing tag.
They typically have a separate label as part of the web page&#8217;s
displayed text, like &#8220;Number 1:&#8221; and &#8220;Number 2:&#8221;.
The browser shows a box for the user input.</p>
<p>The important input attributes for us here are <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong>.</p>
<p>The initial <strong>value</strong> attribute string is what the user sees inside the input box
when the page is first displayed.
When the user changes the text in the box,
it is remembered as a replacement <strong>value</strong> attribute&#8217;s string, to be later passed
on to the cgi program.</p>
<p>In order for the cgi program to know which <strong>value</strong> is which, the <strong>name</strong>
attribute is used.  In cgi programs the form accessing methods like
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getfirst</span></code> must have the first parameter match
<em>the quoted string in the associated</em> <strong>name</strong> <em>attribute in the form</em>.
For example, in a cgi file, the method call <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form.getfirst('x')</span></code> makes sense
<em>only</em> if there is an input tag in the html form page with attribute <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name=&quot;x&quot;</span></code>
(as we have in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">adder.html</span></code>).</p>
<p>Forms can have any number of input fields like these, distinguished in the cgi script by
their <strong>name</strong> attribute.</p>
<p>A form must always have exactly one special input tag like in line 17:
The attributes here are somewhat different: <strong>value</strong> and <strong>type</strong>.
The <strong>type</strong> attribute must be
assigned the string <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;submit&quot;</span></code>.  With this <strong>type</strong>,
the <strong>value</strong> attribute&#8217;s string does not appear in a user-editable input box.
Instead it is the label text on the <em>submit button</em>.  When the user clicks
on that button, the browser immediately sends all the form&#8217;s input
to the cgi program given in the form&#8217;s <strong>action</strong> attribute .  Then the next page viewed
in the browser is the one produced by the cgi program....</p>
<p>This is all you really need if you just are going to get user data from
text input fields, as in the Chapter 4 exercises.
Between your form&#8217;s starting and ending tag,
you can have any number of input tags with different <strong>name</strong>
attributes values to record user text.
You must have exactly one input tag in the form with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type=&quot;submit&quot;</span></code>.</p>

<p>You have probably seen other input and display mechanisms on web pages,
like radio buttons and check boxes.</p>
<p>You can see an example by running the pizza1.cgi URL in the optional Tutorial section
ref:<cite>More-Advanced-Examples</cite>.</p>
<p>The form here is created in the cgi program from a template page,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pizzaOrderTemplate1.html</span></code> in the examples sub-folder www,
which shows the syntax that you can copy for input tags where the
<strong>type</strong> attribute has string value &#8220;checkbox&#8221;, &#8220;radio&#8221;, or &#8220;hidden&#8221;:

<p>Radio buttons allow you to make a unique choice among multiple options in a group.
If you click on one, and then another, the selection of the previous one is removed and the later one is noted instead.
Lines 19, 21, and 23 show a group of radio buttons, with text after each one describing its meaning.
They are radio buttons because of the attribute settings <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type=&quot;radio&quot;</span></code>.
They form a group, because the <strong>name</strong> attribute&#8217;s string value is the <em>same</em> for each. (In this case, name=&#8221;size&#8221;).
The <strong>value</strong> of the chosen one is passed to the cgi program.
When the cgi program calls <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form.getfirst('size')</span></code>, just the string assigned to the selected input&#8217;s <strong>value</strong> attribute is returned.  Here it would be
&#8216;small&#8217;, &#8216;medium&#8217; or &#8216;large&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you want to allow multiple <em>simultaneous</em> selections from a group,
use input tag attribute <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type=&quot;checkbox&quot;</span></code>, as in lines 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35.
Other than this new string value for the <strong>type</strong> attribute, the syntax in this tag is like for radio buttons, with distinct assignments to the <strong>value</strong> attribute.
In the cgi program, however, you access the data differently:
Read the results of a group of check boxes
with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getlist</span></code> method, that returns a <em>list</em> of the values of checked checkboxes.
For instance if the user of this form checks for sausage, onions, and extra cheese,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form.getlist('topping')</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">['sausage',</span> <span class="pre">'onions',</span> <span class="pre">'extra</span> <span class="pre">cheese']</span></code>.</p>
<p id="index-5">Finally, there is a major complication when wanting to go back and forth,
running a sequence of cgi programs, displaying
a sequence of forms in between to get further user input.
Even if you are running the same cgi program each time,
each call the the cgi program is <em>independent</em>:
Nothing is automatically remembered from the previous call the the cgi program.
If you want to remember things defined in a previous call to a cgi program,
then the output of the earlier cgi program
can have a form with one or more input fields
with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type=&quot;hidden&quot;</span></code>.</p>
<p>Here &#8220;input&#8221; is not referring to <em>user</em> input in the form:
<em>Nothing about this tag is visible to the user of the form.</em>
The input is input <em>into the following cgi program</em> from the the form.
It can be read in the cgi program
via its <strong>value</strong> attribute, like a regular text box input.</p>
<p>This syntax it pretty straightforward. Explaining its use
in the cgi program <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pizza1.cgi</span></code> is more involved:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The first time the cgi program is called directly with
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://localhost:8080/pizza1.cgi</span></code>.
Then there was <em>not</em> a previous form feeding into it,
so when this initial execution of the cgi program
calls
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form.getfirst('pastState',</span> <span class="pre">'')</span></code>,
the default <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">''</span></code> is returned, indicating there was no earlier form,</li>
<li>After testing this value in an if-statement,
the cgi program chooses to <em>create</em> the form for an order.
Note the braces various places in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pizzaOrderTemplate1.html</span></code>:  This
is not a final html page.  It is used as a format string to create a page.
The cgi program creates its output, which is a form,
substituting <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'order'</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{state}</span></code> in line 40.
This form is created and sent back to the user&#8217;s browser,
so the hidden input
field with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name=&quot;pastState&quot;</span></code> has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">value=&quot;order&quot;</span></code>.</li>
<li>In the browser, the user fills in the fields in the order form.
The user does <em>not</em> see the hidden input field, but it is there.
The user submits the form back to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pizza1.cgi</span></code>,
so <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pizza1.cgi</span></code> executes a <em>second</em> time.</li>
<li>In the second execution of the cgi program, the call is made again:
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form.getfirst('pastState',</span> <span class="pre">'')</span></code>
and this time <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'order'</span></code> is returned, since it was specified in the
hidden field in the form.
Hence the cgi program sees that
there <em>was</em> a previous form.  Then the cgi program goes through the code to
read the order fields and process the data to return a response page.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a huge amount to learn about more elaborate HTML that we are omitting:
All sort of formatting,
form actions acted on within the browser via the programming language <em>javascript</em> (without server interaction),
custom formatting rules via cascading style sheets (CSS), ....</p>
<p>What we have in this tutorial appendix is sufficient to have simple pages interact with a server.</p>
