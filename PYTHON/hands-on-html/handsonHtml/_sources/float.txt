Decimals, Floats, and Floating Point Arithmetic
===============================================

Floating point numbers like 12.345 are a basic type, but there are
some complications due to their inexactness. This section may be
deferred until you actually need numbers other than integers.

Floats, Division, Mixed Types
-----------------------------
   
As you moved on in school from your first integer division to
fractions and decimals, you probably thought of 6/8 as a
fraction and could convert to a decimal .75. Python can do decimal
calculations, too, *approximately*.

*Try all set-off lines in this section in the* *Shell*::

    6/8 
    6/3 
    2.3/25.7 

There is more going on here than meets the eye. As you should know,
decimal representations of values can be a pain. They may not be
able to be expressed with a finite number of characters. Try ::

    2/3

Also, as you may have had emphasized in science class, real number
measurements are often not exact, and so the results of
calculations with them are not exact. In fact there are an infinite
number of real number just between 0 and 1, and a computer is
finite. It cannot store all those numbers exactly! On the other
hand, Python does store *integers* exactly (well at least far past
the number of atoms in the universe - eventually even integers
could get too big to store in a computer). The difference in the
way integers and decimals are stored and processed leads to
decimals and integers being different *type*\ s in Python. Try ::

    type(3.5)

Note that 3.5 is of type 'float', not 'decimal'. There are several
reasons for that name having to do with the actual way the type is
stored internally. "Decimal" implies base ten, our normal way for
writing numbers with ten digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Computers
actually use base two, with only two symbols 0,1. (Did you note
what symbols were in the machine language in :ref:`Context`?)
Also floats use an encoding something like scientific notation from
science class, with exponents that allow the decimal point to move
or "float", as in the decimal case: 2345.6 = (2.3456)10\ :sup:`3`

Try ::

    type(-2) 
    type(-2.0) 

Even a number that is actually an integer can be represented in the
float type if a decimal point is included.

Always be sure to remember that floats may not be exact. The use of
base two makes this true even in cases where decimal numbers *can*
be expressed exactly! More on that in :ref:`Precision-Formats`.

It is sometimes important to know the numeric type of the
result of a binary operation.
Any combination of +, -, and * with operands of type int
produces an int. If there is an operation /, or if either operand is
of type float, the result is float. Try each in the *Shell* (and
guess the resulting type): [#]_ ::

    3.3 - 1.1 
    2.0 + 3 
    2*2.5 

.. [#]
   Python 3 does what you would expect mathematically with an
   expression like ``(1/2)*6.5``

   *Caution:*  This is not the case in other common languages like Java
   and C++ (or with Python 2). They treat the /
   operation with integers like the current Python //, so the result
   of the expression above is 0, since ``1//2`` is 0.

.. _Exponentiation:
   
Exponentiation, Square Roots
---------------------------- 

Exponentiation is finding powers. In mathematical notation,
(3)(3)(3)(3)=3\ :sup:`4`. In Python there is no fancy
typography with raised exponent symbols like the 4, so Python uses
\*\* before a power: Try in the *Shell*::

    3**4 
    5*2**3 


If you expected 1000 for the second expression, remember exponentiation
has even higher precedence than multiplication and division:
2**3 is 2*2*2 or 8, and 5*8 is 40.

.. index::
   square root **
   **; square root

Exponents do not need to be integers. A useful example is the 0.5
power: it produces a square root. Try in the *Shell*::

    9**.5 
    2**.5 

The result of a power operation is of int type only if both
parameters are integers and the correct result is an integer.

.. _Precision-Formats:
   
String Formats for Float Precision
----------------------------------
   
You generally do not want to display a floating point result of a
calculation in its raw form, often with an enormous number of
digits after the decimal point, like 23.457413902458498. You are
likely to prefer rounding it to something like 23.46. There are two
approaches.

First there is a format *function* (not method) with a second
parameter allowed to specialize the formatting of objects as
strings. *Read* the following example interpreter sequence showing
possibilities when a float is being formatted::

    >>> x = 23.457413902458498 
    >>> s = format(x, '.5f') 
    >>> s
    '23.45741'
    >>> format(x, '.2f') 
    '23.46'
    >>> x
    23.457413902458498
    

Note that the results are rounded not *truncated*: the result to
two places is 23.46, not 23.45. The formatting string ``'.5f'``
means round to 5 places after the decimal point. Similarly
``'.2f'`` means round to two decimal places.

.. warning::  This ``format`` function *returns* the formatted string.
   It does not change the parameters.  As a  *complete* statement
   in a *program* ``format(x, '.2f')``, is useless:  The 
   ``'23.46'`` gets returned and *thrown away*, with no effect on ``x``.
   
The first version, saving the formatted value to ``s``, will allow the 
formatted string to be used again (as ``s``).

This rounding notation can also be placed after a colon inside the
braces of format strings, for use with the string format *method*.
You can put a colon ``:`` and the 
formatting information we used in the simple format method above (like ``.5f``.
but with NO quotes)
Recall there are many ways to indicate what values to substitute 
into a format string.  The first way introduced 
is just to omit any reference to the variables 
and substitute the method's parameters in order as in:: 

    >>> x = 2.876543 
    >>> y = 16.3591 
    >>> 'x long: {:.5f}, x short: {:.3f}, y: {:.2f}.'.format(x, x, y) 
    'x long: 2.87654, x short: 2.877, y: 16.36.' 

The first part inside the formatting braces can also indicate what
value to substitute, as when using a dictionary. ::

    >>> x = 2.876543 
    >>> 'long: {x:.5f}, short: {x:.3f}.'.format(**locals()) 
    'long: 2.87654, short: 2.877.' 


The instructions for the data to insert
can also be given by position index (from the optional end of :ref:`Format-Strings`)::

    >>> x = 2.876543 
    >>> 'longer: {0:.5f}, shorter: {0:.3f}.'.format(x) 
    'longer: 2.87654, shorter: 2.877.' 

In each of these approaches, the colon and formatting specification 
come at the end of the expression inside the braces, 
just before the closing ``}``.  This follows the ``{`` and symbols (if any) 
identifying what value to use for the substitution.  

There are many more fancy formatting options for the string
``format`` method that we will not discuss.

.. index:: float; approximation
   approximation

Going to the opposite extreme, and using formatting with many
digits, you can check that Python does not necessarily remember
simple decimal numbers exactly::

    >>> format(.1, '.20f') 
    '0.10000000000000000555' 
    >>> format(.2, '.20f') 
    '0.20000000000000001110' 
    >>> format(.1 + .2, '.20f') 
    '0.30000000000000004441' 
    >>> format(.3, '.20f') 
    '0.29999999999999998890' 

Python stores the numbers correctly to about 16 or 17 digits. You
may not care about such slight errors, but you will be able to
check in Chapter 3 that if Python tests the expressions .1 + .2 and
.3 for equality, it decides that they are not equal! In fact, as
you can see above, the approximations that Python stores for the
two expressions are *not* exactly equal.

..  warning::
    Do not depend on the
    exactness of floating point arithmetic, even for apparently simple
    expressions!

Floating point formatting code similar to this section is also in
example program ``floatFormat.py``.

Floating Point Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program, ``discount.py``, that prompts the user for an
original price and for a discount percentage and prints out the new
price to the nearest cent. For example if the user enters 2.89 for
the price and 20 for the discount percentage, the value would be

   (1 - 20/100) * 2.89 
   
rounded to two decimal places, 2.31. For price
.65 with a 25 percent discount, the value would be 

   (1 - 25/100) * .65
   
rounded to two decimal places, .49. [#]_

Write the general calculation code following the pattern of
the calculations illustrated in the two concrete examples.

.. [#]
   In Python 3.0+, the previous expressions make sense, but in earlier
   versions of Python and in other languages like C++ and Java, where
   there are not separate division operators // and /, these
   expressions would be wrong because of the multiple meanings of the
   operator / with different types. The expressions would work in
   these other languages if, for example, 100 were replaced by 100.0.
