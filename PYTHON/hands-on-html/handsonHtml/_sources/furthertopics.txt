Further Topics to Consider
==========================
        
Chapter 4 gives an application of Python to the web. It does not
introduce new language features. We have come to end of the new
language features in this tutorial, but there are certainly more
basic topics to learn about programming and Python in particular,
if you continue in other places:

#. Creating your own kinds of objects (writing classes)

#. Inheritance: Building new classes derived from existing classes

#. Python list indexing and slicing, both to read and change parts
   of lists

#. Other syntax used with loops: ``break``, ``continue``, and
   ``else``

#. Exception handling

#. Python's variable length parameter lists, and other options in
   parameter lists

#. List comprehensions: a concise, readable, fast Pythonic way to
   make new lists from old ones

#. Event handling in graphical programming

#. Listing, moving and deleting stored files; creating folders

#. Recursion (not special to Python): a powerful programming
   technique where functions call themselves

Beyond these language features, Python has a vast collection of
useful modules. For example, I wrote a real-world
program, sakaihw.py, that I have in regular use for processing large numbers of
files submitted to Sakai in homework submissions. It
uses string methods and slicing and
both kinds of loops, as well is illustrating some useful components
in modules sys, os, and os.path, for accessing command line
parameters, listing file directories, creating folders, and
moving and renaming files.
