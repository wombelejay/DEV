Files
=====

This section fits here logically (as an important built-in type of
object) but it is not needed for the next chapter, :ref:`More-On-Flow`.

Thus far you have been able to save programs, but anything produced
during the execution of a program has been lost when the program
ends. Data has not *persisted* past the end of execution. Just as
programs live on in files, you can generate and read data files in
Python that persist after your program has finished running.

As far as Python is concerned, a file is just a string (often very
large!) stored on your file system, that you can read or write,
gradually or all together.

*Directory* is an old name for a folder.  These ideas go back far enough to the
time before directories got a graphical folder representation.  For this
section we use the word directory to mean the same thing as folder.

.. index::
   file; write
   write a file

Writing Files
-------------
   
*Open a directory window for your Python program directory.*
First note that there is no file named sample.txt. 

*Make sure* you have started Idle so the current directory is your
Python program directory.

Run the example program ``firstFile.py``, shown below:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/firstFile.py

The first line creates a file object, which links Python to your
computer's file system. The first parameter in the file constructor
gives the file name, ``sample.txt``. The second parameter indicates
how you use the file. The ``'w'`` is short for **w**\ rite, so you will
be creating and *writing* to a file.

..  warning::
    If the file already existed,  the old contents are
    *destroyed*.

If you do not use
any operating system directory separators in the name (``'\'`` or ``'/'``
depending on your operating system), then the file will lie in the
current directory. The assignment statement gives the Python file
object the name ``outFile``.

The second line writes the specified string to the file.

The last line is important to clean up. Until this line, this
Python program controls the file, and nothing may be actually
written to an operating system file yet:  Since initiating a file operation
is thousands of times
slower than memory operations, Python *buffers* data, saving small
amounts and writing a larger chunk all at once.

..  warning::
    The ``close``
    line is essential for Python to make sure everything is really
    written, and to relinquish control of the file.

It is a common bug
to write a program where you have the code to add all the data you
want to a file, but the program does not end up creating a file.
Usually this means you forgot to close the file.

Now switch focus and look at a directory window for the current
directory. You should now see a file ``sample.txt``. You can open
it in Idle (or your favorite word processor) and see its contents.

For the next example, run the example program ``nextFile.py``, shown below, which has two
calls to the write method:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/nextFile.py

Now look at the file, ``sample2.txt``. Open it in Idle. It may not
be what you expect! The write method for the file is not quite like
a ``print`` function. It does not add anything to the file except
*exactly* the data you tell it to write. If you want a newline, you
must indicate it *explicitly*. Recall the newline code
``'\n'``. Run the example program ``revisedFile.py``,
shown below, which adds newline codes:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/revisedFile.py

Check the contents of sample3.txt.

.. index::
   file; read
   read a file

Reading Files
-------------
   
Run the example program
``printFile.py``, shown below:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/printFile.py

Now you have come full circle: what one Python program has written
into the file ``sample3.txt``, another has read and displayed.

In the first line of the program an operating system file (``sample3.txt``) is
associated again with a Python variable name (``inFile``). The
second parameter again gives the mode of operation, but this time
it is ``'r',`` short for **r**\ ead. This file, ``sample3.txt``, should
already exist, and the intention is to read from it. This is the
most common mode for a file, so the ``'r'`` parameter is actually
*optional*.

The ``read`` method returns all the file's data as a single string,
here assigned to the variable ``contents``. Using the ``close`` method is
generally optional with files being read. There is nothing to lose
if a program ends without closing a file that was being read. [#]_

..  note::
    There are three related but distinct concepts related to files.
    Beginners often get confused and try to merge several in their head 
    or substitute one for another:
    
    #.  The *file name*  is a string that identifies the file in your
        computer's file system.
    #.  You need the file name to ``open`` a file creating a *file* object,
        but the file object (that I tend to call ``inFile`` or ``outFile``)
        is not the same as the name of the file on your hard drive.  You
        assign it to a variable name just for use inside your program.
    #.  There is still one more step to the most important part, the *contents*
        of the file.  The ``read`` method for a file object reads and *returns* 
        existing content, while the ``write`` method writes new content
        into the file.   

There are other methods to read just parts of files (that you can look up
in the Python documentation),
but for this tutorial, reading the whole file with the ``read`` method 
is sufficient.

PrintUpper Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the following programs in sequence. Be sure to save the
programs in the same directory as where you start the idle shortcut
and where you have all the sample text files:

a.  printUpper.py: read the contents of the sample2.txt file
    and print the contents out in upper case. (This should use file
    operations and should work no matter what the contents are in
    sample2.txt. Do not assume the particular string written by
    ``nextFile.py``!)

b.  fileUpper.py: *prompt* the user for a file name, read and
    print the contents of the requested file in upper case.

c.  \* copyFileUpper.py: modify fileUpper.py to write the upper
    case contents string to a new file rather than printing it. 
    Have the name of
    the new file be dynamically derived from the old name by prepending
    'UPPER' to the name. For example, if the user specified the file
    ``sample.txt`` (from above), the program would create a file
    ``UPPERsample.txt``, containing 'MY FIRST OUTPUT FILE!'. When the
    user specifies the file name ``stuff.txt``, the resulting file
    would be named ``UPPERstuff.txt``.

.. _Write-madlib3.py:

Mad Lib File Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write ``madlib3.py``, a small modification
of ``madlib2.py``, requiring only a modification to the ``main``
function of ``madlib2.py``.  (Even better is to start from
``madlib2a.py`` if you did the exercise in :ref:`unique-list-ex`).
Also create a file :file:`myMadlib.txt`, as described below.

Your ``madlib3.py`` should

* *Prompt* the user for the name of a file that should contain a madlib format
  string as text (with no quotes around it).
* Read in this file and use it as the format string in the ``tellStory``
  function.

This is unlike in madlib2.py, where the story is a *literal* string 
coded directly into the program, assigned to the variable ``originalStory``. 
The ``tellstory``
function and particularly the ``getKeys`` function were developed
and described in detail in this tutorial, but for this exercise
there is no need to follow their inner workings - you are just a
*user* of the ``tellstory`` function (and the functions that it
calls). You do not need to mess with the code for the definition of
``tellStory`` or any of the earlier supporting functions  -- 
just keep them from the copy you made of madlib2.py for your
madlib3.py. 
The original madlib string is already placed in a file :file:`jungle.txt`
as an example of the story file format expected. With the Idle editor, write
another madlib format string into a file :file:`myMadlib.txt`. If you
earlier created a  program myMadlib.py, then you can easily extract
the story from there (without the quotes around it). Test your
program madlib3.py twice, using :file:`jungle.txt` and then
your new madlib story file :file:`myMadlib.txt`.

.. [#]
   If, for some reason, you want to reread this same file while the
   same program is running, you need to close it and reopen it.
