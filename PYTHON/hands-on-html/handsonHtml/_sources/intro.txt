Whirlwind Introduction To Types and Functions
============================================================================

.. index:: None; absence of data

Python directly recognizes a variety of types of data. Here are a
few: 

    Numbers: ``3``, ``6``, ``-7``, ``1.25``

    Character strings: ``'hello'``, ``'The answer is: '``

    Lists of objects of any type: ``[1, 2, 3, 4]``,
    ``['yes', 'no', 'maybe']``

    A special datum meaning nothing: ``None``


Python has large collection of built-in functions that operate on
different kinds of data to produce all kinds of results. To make a
function do its action, parentheses are required. These parentheses
surround the parameter or parameters, as in a function in algebra
class.

The general syntax to execute a function is

    *functionName* ``(`` *parameters* ``)``


One function is called ``type``, and it returns the type of any
object. The Python Shell will evaluate functions. In the Shell the
last line should look like ::

    >>> 

.. index:: int; integer
   type; int

Continuing on the same line enter ::

    type(7)

Always remember to end with the :kbd:`Return` (or Enter) key. After the Shell
responds, you should see something like ::

    >>> type(7) 
    <class 'int'> 
    >>>  


In the result, ``int`` is the way Python abbreviates integer. The word *class* is
basically a synonym for type in Python. 

Note that
the line with the value *produced* by the shell does not start with
``>>>`` and appears at the left margin. Hence you can distinguish
what the computer responds from what you type (after the ``>>>`` prompt).

At the end you see a
further prompt where you can enter your next line....

.. index:: float

*For the rest of this section*, at the
``>>>`` prompt in the Python
*Shell*, individually enter each line below that is set off in
``typewriter`` font. So next enter  ::

    type(1.25)

Note the name in the last result is ``float``, not real or decimal,
coming from the term "floating point", for reasons that will be
explained later, in :ref:`Floats-Division-Mixed`. 

.. index:: str; type for string
   string; str type
   type; str
   
Enter ::

    type('hello')

In your last result you see another abbreviation: ``str`` rather
than string. Enter ::

    type([1, 2, 3])

Strings and lists are both sequences of parts (characters or
elements). We can find the **length** of that sequence with another
function with the abbreviated name ``len``. Try both of the
following, separately, in the *Shell*::

    len([2, 4, 6]) 
    len('abcd') 

Some functions have no parameters, so nothing goes between the
parentheses. For example, some types serve as no-parameter
functions to create a simple value of their type. Try  ::

    list()

You see the way an empty list is displayed.

Functions may also take more than one parameter. Try ::

    max(5, 11, 2)

Above, max is short for maximum.

.. index::
   str; conversion
   int; conversion
   conversion - int and str
   
Some of the names of types serve as conversion functions (where
there is an obvious meaning for the conversion). Try each of the
following, one at a time, in the *Shell*::

    str(23) 
    int('125') 

Note the presence and absence of quotes.

.. index:: shell; copy line
   Idle; copy line in shell

*An often handy Shell feature*: an earlier Shell line may to copied
and edited by clicking anywhere in the previously displayed line
and then pressing the :kbd:`Return` (or Enter) key. For instance you should have entered
several lines starting with ``len``. click on any one, press
:kbd:`Return`, and edit the line for a different test.
