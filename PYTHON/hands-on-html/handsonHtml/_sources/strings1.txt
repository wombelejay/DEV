Strings, Part I
===============

Enough with numbers for a while. Strings of characters are another
important type in Python. 

.. index::
   single: string; delimiters 
   single: "
   single: '

.. _String-Delimiters-I:
     
String Delimiters, Part I
---------------------------

A string in Python is a sequence of characters. For Python to
recognize a sequence of characters, like ``hello``, as a string, it
must be enclosed in quotes to delimit the string.

*For this whole section on strings*, continue trying each set-off
line of code in the *Shell*. Try ::

    "hello"

Note that the interpreter gives back the string with *single*
quotes. Python does not care what system you use. Try  ::

    'Hi!'

Having the choice of delimiters can be handy.

Figure out how to give Python the string containing the text:
``I'm happy.`` Try it. If you got an error, try it with another
type of quotes, and figure out why that one works and not the
first.

There are many variations on delimiting strings and embedding
special symbols. We will consider more ways later in
:ref:`Strings-Part-II`.

.. index:: string; empty

..  note::
    A string can have any number of characters in it, including 0. The
    empty string is ``''`` (two quote characters with nothing between
    them).  Many beginners forget that having no characters 
    in the middle is legal. 
    It can be useful.

Strings are a new Python type. Try ::

    type('dog') 
    type('7') 
    type(7) 

The last two lines show how easily you can get confused! Strings
can include any characters, *including* digits. Quotes turn even
digits into strings. This will have consequences in the next
section....

.. index::
   string; concatenation
   concatenation +
   single: +; concatenation
   single: *; string repeat

.. _String-Concatenation:
   
String Concatenation
--------------------
   
Strings also have operation symbols. Try in the *Shell* (noting the
*space* after ``very``)::

    'very ' + 'hot'

The plus operation with strings means *concatenate* the strings.
Python looks at the type of operands before deciding what operation
is associated with the +.

.. index::
   double: string; multiplication 

Think of the relation of addition and multiplication of integers,
and then guess the meaning of ::

    3*'very ' + 'hot'

Were you right? The ability to repeat yourself easily can be
handy.

Predict the following and then test. Remember the last section on
types::

    7+2 
    '7'+'2' 

Python checks the types and interprets the plus symbol based on the
type. Try ::

    '7'+2


With mixed string and int types, Python sees an ambiguous
expression, and does not guess which you want - it just gives an
error!  [#]_

This is a traceback error.  These occur when the code is being executed.
In the last two lines of the traceback it shows the Python line where the error was found, and then
a reason for the error.  Not all reasons are immediately intelligible to
a starting programmer, but they are certainly worth checking out.  In this
case it is pretty direct.  You need to make an explicit conversion, 
so both are strings if you mean concatenation, ``'7' + str(2)``, 
or so both are int if you mean addition, ``int('7') + 2``.  

With literal strings these examples are only useful for illustration:  There is no
reason to write such verbose expressions when you already know the intended result.  
With *variables*, starting in the next section, 
expressions involving these conversions become more important....

String Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
Figure out a *compact* way to get Python to make the string,
``'YesYesYesYesYes'``, and try it. How about
``'MaybeMaybeMaybeYesYesYesYesYes'``? Hint:  [#]_

.. [#]
   Be careful if you are a Java or C# programmer! This is unlike those languages, where
   the 2 would be automatically converted to '2' so the concatenation
   would make sense.

.. [#]
   Hint for the second one: use two \*'s and a +.
