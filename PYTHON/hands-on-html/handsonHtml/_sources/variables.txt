Variables and Assignment
=========================

*Each set-off line in this section should be tried in the Shell.*

Try  ::

    width = 10

*Nothing* is displayed by the interpreter after this entry, so it is
not clear anything happened. Something has happened. This is an
*assignment statement*, with a *variable*, ``width``, on the left.
A variable is a name for a value. An assignment statement
associates a variable name on the left of the equal sign with the
value of an expression calculated from the right of the equal sign.
Enter ::

    width

Once a variable is assigned a value, the variable can be used in
place of that value. The response to the expression ``width`` is
the same as if its value had been entered.

The interpreter does not print a value after an assignment
statement because the value of the expression on the right is not
lost. It can be recovered if you like, by entering the variable
name and we did above.

Try each of the following lines::

    height = 12 
    area = width * height 
    area 

.. index:: syntax error
   error; syntax
   
The equal sign is an unfortunate choice of symbol for assignment,
since Python's usage is not the mathematical usage of the equal
sign. If the symbol ↤ had appeared on keyboards
in the early 1990's, it would probably have been used for
assignment instead of =, emphasizing the asymmetry of assignment.
In mathematics an equation is an *assertion* that *both* sides of
the equal sign *are already, in fact, equal*. A Python assignment
statement *forces* the variable on the left hand side *to become*
associated with the value of the expression on the right side. The
difference from the mathematical usage can be illustrated. Try::

    10 = width

so this is not equivalent in Python to ``width = 10``. The
*left hand* side must be a variable, to which the assignment is
made. Reversed, we get a *syntax error*.  Try ::

    width = width + 5

This is, of course, nonsensical as mathematics, but it makes
perfectly good sense as an assignment, with the right-hand side
calculated first. Can you figure out the value that is now
associated with width? Check by entering ::

    width

In the assignment statement, the expression on the right is
evaluated *first*. At that point ``width`` was associated with its
original value 10, so ``width + 5`` had the value of 10 + 5 which
is 15. That value was then assigned to the variable on the left
(``width`` again) to give it a *new* value. We will modify the
value of variables in a similar way routinely.

.. index::
   double: execution; error 

Assignment and variables work equally well with strings. Try::

    first = 'Sue' 
    last = 'Wong' 
    name = first + ' ' + last 
    name 

Try entering::

    first = fred

Note the different form of the error message. The earlier errors in
these tutorials were *syntax* errors: errors in translation of the
instruction. In this last case the syntax was legal, so the
interpreter went on to execute the instruction. Only *then* did it
find the error described. There are no quotes around ``fred``, so
the interpreter assumed ``fred`` was an identifier, but the name
fred was not defined at the time the line was executed.

It is both easy to forget quotes where you need them for a literal string
and to mistakenly put them around a variable name that should not have them!

Try in the *Shell*::

    fred = 'Frederick'
    first = fred
    first

There ``fred``, without the quotes, makes sense.

There are more subtleties to assignment and the idea of a variable
being a "name for" a value, but we will worry about them later,
in :ref:`Issues-with-Mutable`. They do not come up if our
variables are just numbers and strings.

.. index::
   Idle; autocompletion 
   autocompletion in Idle
   Mac; Alt replacement in Idle
   alt key

**Autocompletion: A handy short cut.** Idle remembers all the
variables you have defined at any moment. This is handy when
editing. Without pressing Enter, type into the Shell just  ::

   f

Windows users:
   Then *hold down* the :kbd:`Alt` key and press the :kbd:`/` key. 
   This key combination is abbreviated :kbd:`Alt-/`.  

Mac users:
   The Windows key combination above may give you a funny character.
   (If so backspace over it.)
   In that case you need to hold down both the :kbd:`control` key and the 
   :kbd:`alt/option` key when pressing the '/'.  
   This may hold in other places in this tutorial, 
   where the Alt key is called for in Windows.)

Assuming you are following on the earlier variable entries to the Shell, you should see ``f`` *autocompleted* to be ::

   first

This is particularly useful if you
have long identifiers! You can press :kbd:`Alt-/` several times if more
than one identifier starts with the initial sequence of characters
you typed. If you press :kbd:`Alt-/` again you should see ``fred``.
Backspace and edit so you have ``fi``, and then and press :kbd:`Alt-/`
again. You should not see fred this time, since it does not start
with ``fi``.

.. index:: literal, identifier

.. _Literals-and-Identifiers:

Literals and Identifiers
------------------------
   
Expressions like ``27`` or ``'hello'`` are called *literals*,
coming from the fact that they *literally* mean exactly what they
say. They are distinguished from variables, whose value is *not*
directly determined by their name.

The sequence of characters used to form a variable name (and names
for other Python entities later) is called an *identifier*. It
identifies a Python variable or other entity.

.. index:: reserved word

There are some restrictions on the character sequence that make up
an identifier:


-  The characters must all be letters, digits, or underscores ``_``,
   and must start with a letter. In particular, punctuation and blanks
   are not allowed.

-  There are some words that are *reserved* for special use in
   Python. You may not use these words as your own identifiers. They
   are easy to recognize in Idle, because they are automatically
   colored orange. For the curious, you may *read* the full list::

      False      await      else       import     pass
      None       break      except     in         raise
      True       class      finally    is         return
      and        continue   for        lambda     try
      as         def        from       nonlocal   while
      assert     del        global     not        with
      async      elif       if         or         yield

There are also identifiers that are automatically defined in
Python, and that you could redefine, but you probably should not
unless you really know what you are doing! When you start the
editor, we will see how Idle uses color to help you know what
identifies are predefined.

.. index:: case sensitive

Python is case sensitive: The identifiers ``last``, ``LAST``, and
``LaSt`` are all different. Be sure to be consistent. Using the
:kbd:`Alt-/` auto-completion shortcut in Idle helps ensure you are
consistent.

.. index::
   identifier; naming conventions
   naming conventions
   camel case
   multiple word identifier
   underscores in identifiers
   
What is legal is distinct from what is conventional or good
practice or recommended. Meaningful names for variables are
important for the humans who are looking at programs, understanding
them, and revising them. That sometimes means you would like to use
a name that is more than one word long, like ``price at opening``,
but blanks are illegal! One poor option is just leaving out the
blanks, like ``priceatopening``. Then it may be hard to figure out
where words split. Two practical options are

-  underscore separated: putting underscores (which are legal) in
   place of the blanks, like ``price_at_opening``.

-  using *camel-case*: omitting spaces and using all lowercase,
   except capitalizing all words after the first, like
   ``priceAtOpening``


Use the choice that fits your taste (or the taste or convention of
the people you are working with).
