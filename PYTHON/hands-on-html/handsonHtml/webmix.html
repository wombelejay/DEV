<span id="format-of-web"></span><h2>Format of Web Page Markup<a class="headerlink" href="#format-of-web-page-markup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Documents can be presented in many forms. A simple editor like Idle
or Windows Notepad produce plain text: essentially a long string
of meaningful characters that appear directly in the final text you view.</p>
<p>Documents can be displayed with formatting of parts of the
document. Web pages allow mixtures of different fonts, italic, and boldfaced
emphases, and different sized text. Microsoft
Word, Open Office, and TextEdit, and Pages, all display documents with various
amounts of formatting. The syntax for the ways different systems
<em>encode</em> the formatting information varies enormously.</p>
<p>If you look at an old Microsoft Word .doc document in a plain text editor
like Notepad, you should be able to find the original text buried
inside, but most of the symbols associated with the formatting are
unprintable gibberish as far as a human is concerned.</p>
<p id="index-1">Hypertext markup language (HTML) is very different in that regard.
It produces a file of entirely human-readable characters, that
could be produced with a plain text editor, but the <em>markup</em>
parts of the file do not appear directly in your browser &#8211;
instead they instruct the browser how to format the page.</p>
<p>For instance in HTML, the largest size of a heading with the text
&#8220;Web Introduction&#8221;, would look like</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&lt;h1&gt;Web Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;</div></blockquote>
<p>The heading format is indicated by bracketing the heading text &#8216;Web
Introduction&#8217; with markup sequences, &lt;h1&gt; beforehand, and &lt;/h1&gt;
afterward. All HTML markup is delimited by <em>tags</em> enclosed in angle
brackets, and most tags come in pairs, surrounding the information
to be formatted. The end tag has an extra &#8216;/&#8217;. Here &#8216;h&#8217; stands for
heading, and the number indicates the relative importance of the
heading. (There is also h2, h3, .... for smaller headings.) In the
early days of HTML, editing was done in a plain text editor, with
the tags being directly typed in by people who memorized all the
codes!</p>
<p id="index-2">With the enormous explosion of the World Wide Web, specialized
software has been developed to make web editing be much like word
processing, with a graphical interface, allowing formatting to be
done by selecting text with a mouse and clicking menus and icons
labeled in more natural language. The software then automatically
generates the necessary markup. An example used in these tutorials
is the free, open source Kompozer from
<a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kompozer/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/kompozer/</a>. It downloads the appropriate version
for either a Windows machine or for OSX versions <em>older than Catalina</em>.
You might download it if you are not already using another environment that lets
you see both the unformatted plain text and the formatted view.</p>
<p>If your operating system supports Kompozer,
you can open it and easily generate a document with a heading,
and italic and boldfaced portions....</p>
<p>An advantage of Kompozer is that by merely clicking on a different bottom tab,
you can see either the raw html source text or a view like you would see in a browser.</p>
<p>If you use a plain text editor to generate the html source,
then you have extra steps to look at the formatted view:
You need to save the file, and separately load it into a browser.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of Kompozer, when working in html source view,
is that the syntax is not color coded.
You may want (or need) to skip Kompozer and just use an editor like Sublime Text.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-html-sourcecode">
<h3>Introduction to HTML sourcecode<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-html-sourcecode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>See the image of the raw html for hello.html.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>I use a convenient plain text editor, Sublime Text (free download)
that colors the syntax of html source, much as Idle colors Python syntax.</p>
<p>The only text that you see in the browser is what appears in the image as black.
Everything else is markup.  Markup tag names are red.</p>
<p>Most of the markup is boilerplate -
I am not going to explain it much.</p>
<p>In particular all the part through the opening tag for the body, &lt;body&gt;,
in lines 1-7 is standard, except for the bit in black, inside the title markup,
on line 4.  This title appears in the tab label in your browser,
not inside the formatted page.</p>
<p>The only parts you actually see on the page are inside the body:
here the body contents are in lines 8-11.</p>
<p>You are likely to want to start with a heading.
Line 8 uses the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;h1&gt;</span></code> markup to create a main heading.</p>
<p>I spaced the text in the body in a strange way, to illustrate
a major feature of html: It reformats if you change the window width.
That means the browser generally chooses the places to wrap to the next line.
In particular <em>any amount of white space</em>, including newlines in your
raw text, are merely treated as a place
where <em>there could be a break to the next line</em>,
or it could just display as a single space before the next word.</p>
<p>This compression of white space also means that I can indent
to note help me keep track of
multi-line contents between opening and closing markup,
and this does not change the html formatting.</p>
<p>Unless you have an extremely narrow window where you display
hello.html in your browser, you should see &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221;
all on one line.  The newline after &#8220;Hello,&#8221; in the raw text
and the blanks before &#8220;world&#8221;,
just turn into a single space.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want an explicit line break, that shows in the browser.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;br&gt;</span></code> markup forces a line break.
In hello.html, that means that no matter how wide your browser window is,
you will always see &#8220;It is a fine day.&#8221;
starting on a line <em>after</em> &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221;.</p>
<p>The final two lines 11-12 are also standard boilerplate,
closing the markup that was started earlier
for the body and the entire html section.</p>
<p>There is plenty of more formatting markup, for fonts, text size and colors,
paragraph styles, ...
that is not discussed here.
Common document editors like Microsoft
Word, Open Office, and TextEdit,
<em>do</em> allow you to generate static html files.
However the source html text is NOT visible through these editors,
and they all add lots of extra formatting information in the html source
that greatly lengthens the file.  Also,
such editors cannot handle html <em>forms</em>, discussed in an appendix.</p>
<p>Special characters</p>
<p>We had markup in Python string literal notation for special characters.
For the strings the markup all started with the backslash character,
so &#8216;n&#8217; is a newline, &#8216;\&#8217; is a displayed backslash ....</p>
<p>In html <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> have special meaning,
so if we want to <em>see</em> those symbols in the browser,
we need a special substitute for the individual characters in the raw html.
Those substitutes start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a semicolon (;),
with an abbreviation in between:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> is replaced by &amp;lt;</div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> is replaced by &amp;gt;</div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> is replaced by &amp;amp;</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> now is used for character markup, we need the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;amp;</span></code>
to <em>display</em> an ampersand in the browser.</p>
<p>The collapsing of whitespace sequences is also a special feature of html.
If you really want more spaces in sequence,
you can use a character that looks like a space,
but is not considered as whitespace by the html formatter.
The character markup is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;nbsp;</span></code> for
Non-Breaking SPace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="html-form-markup">
<h3>HTML Form Markup<a class="headerlink" href="#html-form-markup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For a page that is totally static,
or just displaying output from a
server cgi program, you do not need
form syntax.
However if you want the user to input data into
a cgi program from a web page, then you need a form.</p>
<p>First we introduce the basic syntax needed for
the exercises.  An optional later part
introduces more features that might be useful
in a more elaborate project.</p>
<p>adder.html image</p>
<p>You see colored markup for a simple form above.
A form requires two more markup tags, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unlike the opening markup for tags introduced so far,
they include not only the tag name, but also
<em>attributes</em> inside the angle brackets.
Attributes have a standard format,
with an attribute identifier, an equal sign,
and a double-quoted string.
Attributes are separated by whitespace.</p>
<p>This is illustrated in line 10 for the form,
with syntax coloring:  the identifier and equal signs are purple,
and the quoted strings are green.</p>
<p>In line 10 the form attributes are action, method and enctype.
We will not mess with the atribute identifiers.
The only things inside the opening tags that we will edit for new
examples are the <em>contents of some of the green quoted strings</em>.
This way it is not important inthis course
for you to learn a bunch of html syntax.  You can copy models,
and modify just quoted strings.</p>
<p>A form can only appear nested inside the body.
Input tags can only appear inside the form.</p>
<p>Other tags like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;h1&gt;</span></code> do not need to be inside the form.
They could be just inside the body, but to make sure I have a form,
and nest all the input tags inside,
I like to make the form take up the entire body,
as in lines 10-24.</p>
<p>The one form attribute that is important to set correctly is
the <strong>action</strong> attribute.  This should be the server program
that will act on the data coming from the inputs in the form.
In this case that is adder.cgi.  Be sure you update this field
when you copy to modify for a new page!</p>
<p>The generic input tags used to get data in a form are
like in lines 14 and 18.
They typically have a separate label as part of the
displayed text, like &#8220;Number 1:&#8221; and &#8220;Number 2:&#8221;.
The browser shows a box for the user input.</p>
<p>The most important attributes for us are the name and the value.</p>
<p>The initial value attribute string is what the user sees inside the input box
when the page is first displayed.
When the user changes the text in the box, the new value is remembered to pass
on to the cgi program.</p>
<p>In order for the cgi program to know which value is which, the name
attribute is used.  In cgi programs the form accessing methods like
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getfirst</span></code> must have the first parameter match
<em>the quoted string in the associated name attribute</em>.</p>
<p>Forms can have any number of input fields like these, distinguished by
their name attribute.</p>
<p>They must always have one special input like in line 22:
The attributes here are different: value and type.  The type must be
&#8220;submit&#8221;.  With this type,
the value attribute here does not appear in a user-editable input box.
Instead it is the text on the <em>submit button</em>.  When the user clicks
on that button, the browser immediately sends all the form&#8217;s input
to the forms&#8217;s action attribute cgi program.  Then the next page viewed
in the browser is the one produced by the cgi program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-advance-form-tags-optional">
<h3>More Advance Form Tags (optional)<a class="headerlink" href="#more-advance-form-tags-optional" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You have probably seen other input and display mechanisms on web pages,
like radio buttons and check boxes.</p>
<p>You can see an example by running the pizza1.cgi URL in
ref:<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">More-Advanced-Examples</span></code>.</p>
<p>The form here is created in the cgi program from a template page,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pizzaOrderTemplate1.html</span></code>,
which shows the syntax that you can copy for three more kinds of input:
checkbox, radiobutton, and hidden.</p>
<p>image pizzaOrderTemplate1.html</p>
<p>Radio buttons allow you to make a unique choice among mutiple options in a group.
If you click on one, and then another, the selection of the previous one is removed.
Lines 18, 20, and 22 show a group of radio buttons, with text after each one describing it.
They are radio buttons since that is the kind attribute &#8220;radio&#8221;.
They form a group, because the name attribute is the same for each.
The value of the checked one is passed to the cgi program.</p>
<p>If you want to allow multiple simultaneous selections from a group,
make the kind attribute be &#8220;checkbox&#8221;, as in lines 26, 28, 30, 32, 34.
Other than the kind, the syntax in the form is like for radio buttons.
In the cgi program, hiwever, you access the data diferently:
read the results of a group of check boxes
with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getlist</span></code> method, that returns a list of the values of checked chekboxes.
For instance if the user of this form checks for sausage, onions, and extra cheese,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">form.getlist('topping')</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">['sausage',</span> <span class="pre">'onions',</span> <span class="pre">'extra</span> <span class="pre">cheese']</span></code></p>
<p>Finally, there is a major complication when wanting to go back and forth displaying
a sequence of forms.  Even if you are running the same cgi program after each one,
each call the the cgi program is independent:
nothing is automatically remembered from the previous call the the cgi program.
If you want to remember things defined in a previous call to the cgi program,
you can embed input fields in a form with type attribute &#8220;hidden&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here &#8220;input&#8221; is not referring to <em>user</em> input in the form:
nothing about this tag is visible to the user of the form.
The input is input <em>into the cgi program</em> from the the form.
It can be read via its value attribute like a regular text field input,
with no kind attribute.</p>

<span id="introduction-to-static"></span><span id="index-3"></span><h2>Introduction to Static Pages in Kompozer<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-static-pages-in-kompozer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section introduces the Kompozer web page editor to create
<em>static</em> pages. A <em>static</em> page is one that is created ahead of time
and just opened and used as needed.  This is as opposed to a <em>dynamic</em> page,
which is a custom page generated by software on demand, given some input
parameters.</p>
<p>Kompozer is used because it is free software, and is
pretty easy to use, like a common word processor. Unlike a common
word processor you will be able to easily look at the HTML markup
code underneath. It is not necessary to know a lot about the
details of the markup codes for HTML files to use Kompozer, but you
can <em>see</em> the results of the markup.</p>
<p>We will use static pages later as a part of making dynamic pages,
using the static pages as templates in which we insert data
dynamically.</p>
<p>To creating static web pages</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>However you start Kompozer, go to the menu in Kompozer and select
<span class="menuselection">File ‣ New</span>.
You will get what looks like an empty document.</li>
<li>Look at the bottom of your window. You should see a <strong>Normal</strong>
tab selected, with other choices beside it, including a <strong>Source</strong>
tab. Click on the <strong>Source</strong> tab. You should see that, though you
have added no content, you already have the basic markup to start an
html page!</li>
<li>Click again on the Normal tab to go back to the Normal view (of
no content at the moment).</li>
<li>Assume you are making a home page for yourself. Make a title and
some introductory text. Use regular word processor features like
marking your title as Heading 1 in the drop down box on a menu bar.
(The drop down menu may start off displaying &#8216;Paragraph&#8217; or &#8216;Body
Text&#8217;.) You can select text and make it bold or italics; enlarge it
... using the editing menu or icons.</li>
<li>Before getting too carried away, save your document as
index.html in the existing
<em>www directory under your earlier Python examples</em>. It will save a
lot of trouble if you keep your web work together in this www
directory, where I have already placed a number of files that you will
want to keep together in one directory.</li>
<li>Just for comparison, switch back and forth between the Normal
and Source views to see all that has gone on underneath your view,
particularly if you edited the format of your text. Somewhere
embedded in the Source view you should see all the text you
entered. Some individual characters have special symbols in HTML
that start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon. Again,
it is more important the understand that there are two
different views than to be able to reproduce the Source view from
memory.</li>
<li>You can use your web browser to see how your file looks outside
the editor. The easiest way to do this is to go to the web
browser&#8217;s menu and select something like
<span class="menuselection">File ‣ Open File</span>, and find the index.html
file you just wrote. It should look pretty similar to the way it looked in
Kompozer, but if you had put in hyperlinks, they should now be
active.</li>

<dd><em>My</em> convention for regular Python programs taking
all their input from the keyboard, and producing output displayed
on a web page. These programs can be run like other Python
programs, directly from an operating system folder or from inside
Idle.  They are not a final product, but are a way of breaking
the development process into steps.</dd>
<dt>...cgi</dt>
<dd>Python program to be started from a web browser and run by a web server.
You will develop code using a local web server on your own machine.</dd>
<dt>...html</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Web documents most often composed in an editor like
Kompozer. By <em>my</em> convention, these have a sub-categories</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>...Template.html</dt>
<dd>not intended to be
displayed directly in a browser, but instead are read by a Python
program (...cgi or ...Web.py) to create a template or format string
for a final web page that is dynamically generated inside the
Python program.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="last">Other files ending in .html are intended to be directly viewed
in a web browser. Except for the simple static earlier examples in
<a class="reference internal" href="#introduction-to-static"><span>Introduction to Static Pages in Kompozer</span></a>, they are designed to reside on
a web server, and include forms that can pass information to a Python CGI
program (...cgi).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p id="index-5">To make this work on your computer:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Have all the web pages in the same directory as the example
program localCGIServer.py.  It is easiest to leave it in the www
subdirectory of your examples directory.</li>
<li>Looking ahead to when we get to using a server dynamically
(<a class="reference internal" href="dynamic.html"><em>CGI - Dynamic Web Pages</em></a>):<ol class="arabic">
<li>Include the Python CGI server programs in the same directory.</li>
<li>Have localCGIServer.py running, started from a directory window,
<em>not from inside Idle</em></li>
<li>In the browser URL field, <em>the web page file name must be</em>
<em>preceded by</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>. For example,
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/adder.html">http://localhost:8080/adder.html</a> would refer to the file
adder.html, in the same directory as the running
localCGIServer.py.  The URL may either by an html file or
possibly a CGI file.  For example, <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/now.cgi">http://localhost:8080/now.cgi</a>
would call the file now.cgi (assuming it is in the same directory as
the running localCGIServer.py).</li>
<li>Most often CGI programs are
referenced in a web form, and the program is called <em>indirectly</em> by
the web server. CGI programs can be edited and saved inside Idle,
but they do <em>not</em> run properly from inside Idle.  They must be run
via the server/browser combination.  More on this later.</li>
